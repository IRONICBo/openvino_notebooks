# Vehicle Detection And Recognition with OpenVINO

![result](data/vehicle-result.png)

Thousands of vehicles are running in road.We can detect a single vehicle from a raw image and recognize attributes of vehicles.In this notebook,we use detection model and recognition model to realize the target.


## Notebook Contents

In this notebook, we will use both detection model and classification model with OpenVINO.We use [Object Detection Models](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/intel/vehicle-detection-0200) and [Object Recognition Models](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/intel/vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039) from [Intel Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/intel/index.md).Detection model is used to detect vehicle position.Besides, we crop single vehicle and infer with classification model to recognize attributes of single vehicle.The pipline is hereï¼š
